bal'ukbar constructive grammar
==============================

Version 0.1 (This is still a work in progress and not useable. Also these documents are by no means a formal description of the grammar, instead they are a dense definition of the language. There are large portions missing, outdate, wrong and whatever.)

Introduction
------------

Bal'ukbar is a constructed language (conlang). To be more precise an engineered language.

Here, have an example:

**malan vo'ele cor nia vii huahua**  
malan (vo('ele) cor (nia) vii (huahua))  
Q.listener.is.topic towards.speaker-move to east like wind  
"Will you go east to me, fast like the wind?"  

While the conlang is very flexible and open to ongoing change and evolution there are some core properties that define it.

* Every element of speech is optional.
* Nouns and adjectives are the same.

There are no goals to this language other than to be a consistent realization of those initial properties and to be pleasing to it's creator.
Those requirements lead to a typological unusual language. Other than that it has some features that might be interesting.

### Every element of speech is optional

You can't say "You can't say." because then you could say "You can* say." instead.

### Nouns and adjectives are the same

Jorge Luis Borges writes in his short story "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" about the languages of the world of Tlön.
> The preceding applies to the languages of the southern hemisphere. In those of the northern hemisphere (on whose Ursprache there is very little data in the Eleventh Volume) the prime unit is not the verb, but the monosyllabic adjective. The noun is formed by an accumulation of adjectives. They do not say "moon," but rather "round airy-light on dark" or "pale-orange-of-the-sky" or any other such combination. In the example selected the mass of adjectives refers to a real object, but this is purely fortuitous. The literature of this hemisphere (like Meinong's subsistent world) abounds in ideal objects, which are convoked and dissolved in a moment, according to poetic needs. At times they are determined by mere simultaneity. There are objects composed of two terms, one of visual and another of auditory character: the color of the rising sun and the faraway cry of a bird. There are objects of many terms: the sun and the water on a swimmer's chest, the vague tremulous rose color we see with our eyes closed, the sensation of being carried along by a river and also by sleep. These second-degree objects can be combined with others; through the use of certain abbreviations, the process is practically infinite. There are famous poems made up of one enormous word. This word forms a poetic object created by the author. The fact that no one believes in the reality of nouns paradoxically causes their number to be unending.

While I had no intention to develop the described language, because it is based off a similar philosophy it turned out pretty much like this.
So to say the language is "descriptive" in the meaning that things are not referred by names, but mostly described. It can happen that two persons trough out a conversation use entirely different noun phrases to refer to the same things. In this way it is extremely subjective.
