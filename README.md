bal'ukbar constructive grammar
==============================

Version 0.1 (This is still a work in progress and not useable. Also these documents are by no means a formal description of the grammar, instead they are a dense definition of the language. There are large portions missing, outdate, wrong and whatever.)


Language of Ukbar
-----------------

Bal'ukbar is a constructed language (conlang). To be more precise an engineered language.  
This means I am inventing (or mostly remixing) a speakable language and its associated culture.  
My current plan is to develop it to a point where I can start learning it.

Here, have an example:

**tu maa ti vo'ele cor nia vii huahua**  
[tu maː ti βɔ.ʔɛ.lɛ˦ tɕɔr nia˦ viː ua˦.ua]  
tu maa ti (vo('ele) cor (nia) vii (huahua))  
listener.is.topic Q change towards.speaker-move to east like wind  
"Will you come east to me, fast like the wind?"  


Structure of this documentation
-------------------------------

"[Introduction](Introduction.md)" gives an overview over the intentions and philosophy and what makes it special.  
"[Phonology](Phonology.md)"  
"[Grammar](Grammar.md)"  
"[Evolution](Evolution.md)" lists planed changes in the the order they will be applied.  
"[Lexicon](Lexicon.md)" lists all words not explained in the Grammar in no particular order.


License
-------

Even though, according to my understanding, you can not license a language I want to explicitly state, that this language is in the public domain.

This documentation is licenced under CC-BY-SA.  
If anyone for some reason is using this conlang I also want to encourage them to publish their original writings too under a free and copyleft license.
