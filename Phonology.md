Writing is lowercase only.  
< h > is silent word initial. Vowel preceding h are lengthened. < VhV > /VːV/.  
Geminated consonants (e.g. pakku) are either lengthened or separated by copying the next vowel (e.g. pakuku).  
All vowels can be long. Written by doubling e.g. "cii"  
Vowel length is only distinctive in monosyllabic words.  
p-b k-g '-h are allophones in most cases. '-h are only distinctive word initial.  


<div id='Vowel-Harmony'/>

### Vowel Harmony

        y
    i--/-\--u
     \/   \/
     e\---/o
       \ /
        a

Vowels come in two groups differing by advanced and retracted tongue root.

* [+ATR] a u i
* [-ATR] o y e

They can be seen as the remains of a former vowel harmony which is no longer productive. Still most morphemes come with either one of those groups.  
Only vowels within a group can form diphthongs.  
High to low and front to back combinations are more common.  


<div id='Syllables'/>

### Syllables

(C)V(R)  
(C)VV  
CN(V)  

syllable | example
-------- | -------
1 mora:  |
V	     | ho
CV	     | ka
CN	     | mn
2 mora:  |
Vː	     | hyy
VV	     | hai
CVː	     | gaa
CVV	     | pye
CVR	     | sen
CNV	     | bra

Syllables with one mora are written with two letters.  
Those with two mora are written with three letters.  
h is used to fill the gaps.  
CN syllables only appear as monosyllabic words (mostly interrogations) or word final.

R = n t j r l k  
N = n v s r l (act syllabic)  
V = a u i o y e  
Vː = aa uu ii oo yy ee  
VV = ye yo ia ai au ua (ey eo oe oy iu ui)

<div id='Stress'/>

### Stress

Stress is optional and may fall on the second mora of the word root, ignoring prefixes.
It is realized with high pitch. In syllables with two morae this can be interpreted as rising, or falling tone.

Examples:  
paKAla     [pʰa'kʰa˦.la]  
paTUp      [pʰa'tu˦˧.p]  
bal-'uKbar [pal'ʔuk˧˦.par]

Monsylabic words are generaly unstressed, while some carry an inherent high tone.

Examples:  
vii [βii]
bat [bat]
bai [pai˦]
ny  [nɨ]
ne  [nɛ˦]
