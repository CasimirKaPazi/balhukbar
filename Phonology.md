### Phonemes

|                   | Bilabial | Linguolabial | Postalveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
| ----------------- |:--------:|:------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-----:|:-------:|
| Plosive           | p        | t̼ (p̈)        | t        | c       | k     |         |
| Nasal             | m        | n̼ (m̈)        | n        | ɲ (ñ)   | [ŋ]   |         |
| Trill             |          |              | r        |         |       |         |

|       | Front | Central | Back  |
| ----- |:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|
| Close |   i   |         |   u   |
| Mid   |   ɛ   |         |   ɔ   |
| Open  |       |    a    |       |

The consonants with a double dot (p̈ m̈ v̈) and ł are linguolabial consonants.
They are pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching the upper lip. In [reverence videos](http://teaching.ncl.ac.uk/ipa/consonants-extra.html) by IPA online you can see them.
However in balhuqpar they aren't pronounce as distinctive as shown. The tongue only touches the underside of the lip and doesn't leave the mouth. The tongue is very relaxed and wide for /t̼ n̼ ð̼/ and tense for /l̼/.
Because the linguolabials sound close to [t n s], /t n r ʃ l/ are pronounced postalveolar.

Before other rounded vowels /i ɛ/ are [y œ].

### Syllables

(C)V(R)

R = /P N R L F/ < q n r l j >  

For historic reasons some syllables of the Form CCV or CC also exist.


<div id='Stress'/>

### Stress

A foot contains three mora. Stress falls on the third mora. Foot are counted from the left. Primary stress falls onto the first foot.

Examples:  
p̈akala     [t̼a.ka'la]  
p̈atup      [t̼a.tu'p̚]  
palhuqpar [pal'uk̚.paɾ]
tenolotatakena [tɛ.nɔ'lɔ.ta.ta'kɛ.na]
tuqcyqtena [tup̚'cik̚.tɛ'na]

One and two moraic words are unstressed, while some carry an inherent high tone.
Those with high tone are marked in the lexicon in normal writing this is omitted.

Examples:  
pāi [pai˦]  
vii [ɸii]  
nē  [nɛ˦]  
paq [pap]  
ñi  [ɲi]  


<div id='Coda'/>

### Coda

Coda consonants are archiphonemes and agree with the consonant that follows them in place of articulation.

|     | Bilabial | Linguolabial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | End of Word |
|:---:|:--------:|:------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-----:|:-----------:|
| /P/ | k̚       | t̼            | k̚       | p̚      | p̚    | ʔ           |
| /N/ | m        | n̼            | n        | ɲ       | ŋ     | m~ŋ         |
| /R/ | r        | l̼            | r        | r       | r     | r           |
| /L/ | l        | l̼            | l        | l       | l     | l           |
| /F/ | v        | ð̼            | ç        | ç       | ç     || ç           |

If a coda is followed by a phoneme with the same manner of articulation, it results in gemination of the second phoneme (e.g. sanmu [ʃamːu]).
