### Phonemes

|                   | Bilabial | Linguolabial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
| ----------------- |:--------:|:------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-----:|:-------:|
| Plosive           | p        | t̼ (p̈)        | t        | c       | k     | ʔ  (')  |
| Nasal             | m        | n̼ (m̈)        | n        | ɲ (ñ)   | [ŋ]   |         |
| Trill             | ʙ (r̈)    |              | r [ɾ]    |         |       |         |
| Fricative         | ɸ (v)    | ð̼ (v̈)        | ʃ (s)    | ç (j)   |       | Ø~h~x   |
| Lateral           |          | ɬ̼~l̼ (ł/l̈)    | l        |         |       |         |

|       | Front | Central | Back  |
| ----- |:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|
| Close |   i   |    ɨ    |   u   |

| Open  |       |    a    |       |

Writing is lowercase only.  
< h > is either not pronounced or varies between [h] and [x].
The glottal stop and h are only distinctive word initial.  
All vowels can be long. Written by doubling e.g. "cii"
Vowel length is only distinctive in monosyllabic words.  
The consonants with a double dot (p̈ m̈ v̈) are linguolabial consonants.
They are pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching the upper lip. In [reverence videos](http://teaching.ncl.ac.uk/ipa/consonants-extra.html) by IPA online you can see them. However in balhuqpar they aren't pronounce as distinct as shown. The tongue only touches the underside of the lip and doesn't leave the mouth. The tongue is very relaxed and wide for [t̼ n̼ ð̼] and tense for [ɬ̼].
Their sound is close to [t n s]. Therefor alveolar consonants are sometime pronounced slightly retroflex.  

Dipthongs are: ai au ia ua iu

<div id='Syllables'/>

### Syllables

(C)N/[V(V/R)]

More readable:
(C)V(R)  
(C)VV  
CN(V)  

syllable | example
-------- | -------
1 mora:  |
V	     | ho
CV	     | ka
CN	     | mn
2 mora:  |
Vː	     | hyy
VV	     | hai
CVː	     | kaa
CVV	     | p̈ie
CVR	     | sen
CNV	     | r̈a

Syllables with one mora are written with two letters.  
Those with two mora are written with three letters.  
h is used to fill the onset.  
CN syllables mostly appear as monosyllabic words (mostly interrogations) or word final. The cluster is voiced.

R = n q j r l  
N = n v s r l (act syllabic)  
V = a u i o y e  
Vː = aa uu ii oo yy ee  
VV = ai au ia ua iu


<div id='Stress'/>

### Stress

A foot contains three mora. Stress falls on the third mora. Foot are counted from the left. Primary stress falls onto the first foot.

Examples:  
p̈akala     [t̼a.ka'la]  
p̈atup      [t̼a.tu'p]  
palhuqpar [pal'uk.paɾ]
tenolotatakena [tɛ.nɔ'lɔ.ta.ta'kɛ.na]
tuqcyqtena [tup'tɕɨk.tɛ'na]

One and two moraic words are unstressed, while some carry an inherent high tone.
Those with high tone are marked in the lexicon in normal writing this is omitted.

Examples:  
pāi [pai˦]  
vii [ɸii]  
nē  [nɛ˦]  
paq [pap]  
ñy  [ɲɨ]  


<div id='Coda'/>

### Coda

Coda consonants are archiphonemes and agree with the consonant that follows them in place of articulation.

|     | Bilabial | Linguolabial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal | End of Word |
|:---:|:--------:|:------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-----:|:-------:|:-----------:|
| /P/ | p        | t̼            | t        | k       | k     | t.h     | p           |
| /P/ | k̚       | t̼            | k̚       | p̚      | p̚    | t.h     | p̚          |
| /N/ | m        | n̼            | n        | ɲ       | ŋ     | n.h     | m~ŋ         |
| /R/ | r        | ɬ̼            | r        | r       | r     | r.h     | ɾ           |
| /L/ | l        | ɬ̼            | l        | l       | l     | l.h     | l           |
| /V/ | v        | ð̼            | ç        | ç       | ç     | ç.h     | ç           |

If a consonant is followed by a similar phonome, it results in gemiantion (e.g. sanmu [ʃamːu]).  

Note these exceptions:
Lr > [rː]  
Pp > [k̚p]  
Pt > [k̚t]  
Pc > [p̚tɕ]  
Pk > [p̚k]
