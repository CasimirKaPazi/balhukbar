### Phonemes

|                   | Bilabial | Linguolabial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
| ----------------- |:--------:|:------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-----:|:-------:|
| Plosive           | p        | t̼ (p̈)        | t        |         | k     | ʔ  (')  |
| Nasal             | m        | n̼ (m̈)        | n        | ɲ (ń)   | [ŋ]   |         |
| Trill             | ʙ (br/ř) |              | r        |         |       |         |
| Affricative       |          |              | [ɾ]      | tɕ (c)  |       | Ø~h~x   |
| Fricative         | ɸ (v)    | ð̼ (v̈)        | ʃ (s)    | ç (j)   |       |         |
| Lateral fricative |          |              | ɬ (ł)    |         |       |         |
| Lateral           |          | [l̼]          | l        |         |       |         |

|       | Front | Central | Back  |
| ----- |:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|
| Close |   i   |    ɨ    |   u   |
| Mid   |   ɛ   |         |   ɔ   |
| Open  |       |    a    |       |

Writing is lowercase only.  
< h > is either not pronounced or varies between [h] and [x].
The glottal stop and h are only distinctive word initial.  
All vowels can be long. Written by doubling e.g. "cii"
Vowel length is only distinctive in monosyllabic words.  
The consonants with a douple dot (p̈ m̈ v̈) are linguolabial consonants.
They are pronounced with the tip of the tounge touching the upper lip.
The sound is close to /t n s/.
Therefor aveolar consonants are sometime pronounced slightly retroflex.  
For broad transcription this documentation uses the dotted symbols instead of the correct IPA ones, as they are easyer to read.


<div id='Vowel-Harmony'/>

### Vowel Harmony

        y
    i--/-\--u
     \/   \/
     e\---/o
       \ /
        a

Vowels come in two groups differing by advanced and retracted tongue root.

* [+ATR] a u i
* [-ATR] o y e

They can be seen as the remains of a former vowel harmony which is no longer productive. Still most morphemes come with either one of those groups.  
Only vowels within a group can form diphthongs.  
High to low and front to back combinations are more common.  


<div id='Syllables'/>

### Syllables

(C)V(R)  
(C)VV  
CN(V)  

syllable | example
-------- | -------
1 mora:  |
V	     | ho
CV	     | ka
CN	     | mn
2 mora:  |
Vː	     | hyy
VV	     | hai
CVː	     | kaa
CVV	     | p̈ye
CVR	     | sen
CNV	     | řa

Syllables with one mora are written with two letters.  
Those with two mora are written with three letters.  
h is used to fill the gaps.  
CN syllables mostly appear as monosyllabic words (mostly interrogations) or word final. The cluster is voiced.

R = n q j r l  
N = n v s r l (act syllabic)  
V = a u i o y e  
Vː = aa uu ii oo yy ee  
VV = ye yo ia ai au ua (ey eo oe oy iu ui)


<div id='Stress'/>

### Stress

Stress is optional and may fall on the second mora of the word root, ignoring prefixes.
It is realized with high pitch. In syllables with two morae this can be interpreted as rising, or falling tone.

Examples:  
p̈aKAla     [p̈a'ka˦.la]  
p̈aTUp      [p̈a'tu˦˧.p]  
pal-huQpar [pal'ʔup˧˦.par]

Monsylabic words are generally unstressed, while some carry an inherent high tone.
Those with high tone are marked in the lexicon in normal writing this is omitted.

Examples:  
vii [ɸii]
paq [pap]
pāi [pai˦]
ńy  [nɨ]
nē  [nɛ˦]


<div id='Coda'/>

### Coda

Coda in this case means consonants diphthongs and long vowels.
e.g. pa-q pa-i vi-i.  

Coda consonants are archiphonemes and agree with the consonant that follows them in place of articulation.
There are:

|     | Bilabial | Linguolabial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal | End of Word |
|:---:|:--------:|:------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-----:|:-------:|:-----------:|
| /P/ | p        | p            | t        | k       | k     | t.h     | p           |
| /N/ | m        | n̼            | n        | ɲ       | ŋ     | n.h     | m~ŋ         |
| /R/ | r        | r            | r        | r       | r     | r.h     | ɾ           |
| /L/ | l        | l̼            | l        | l       | l     | l.h     | l           |
| /V/ | v        | ð̼            | ç        | ç       | ç     | ç.ʔ     | ç           |
