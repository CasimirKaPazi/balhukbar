Writing is lowercase.
< h > is silent word initial. Vowel preceding h are lengthened. < VhV > /VːV/.
All vowels can be long. Written by doubling e.g. "cii"
Vowel length is only distinctive in one syllabic words.
There are strong-weak pairs: m-n, p-b, k-g, '-h, c-j
p-b k-g '-h are allophones in most cases. '-h are only distinctive word initial.

syllable | example
-------- | -------
1 mora:  |
V	     | ho
CV	     | ka
CN	     | mn
2 mora:  |

VV	     | hai
CVː	     | gaa
CVV	     | pye
CVR	     | sen
CNV	     | bra

Syllables with one mora are written with two letters.
Those with two mora are written with three letters.
h is used to fill the gaps.
CN syllables only appear as monosyllabic words (mostly interrogations) or word final.

R = n t j r l k
N = n v s r l (act syllabic)
V = a u i o y e
Vː = aa uu ii oo yy ee
VV = ye yo ia ai au ua (ey eo oe oy iu ui)

     e\---/o
       \ /
        a

Vowels connected by lines can form a diphthong.
This separates the vowels in two groups: a-u-i and o-y-e
The vowels of each group are more likely to appear together in a morpheme.


Word structure
--------------

Word are mostly grouped within three bigger word classes:
* Grammatical particles
 * Interrogations
 * Pronouns
 * Relationals
 * Grammatical markers
 * Auxiliary "verb"
 * Numbers
 * Filters
 * Directions
 * Time markers
 * ...
* Verbs
* Adjectives-Nouns/Content-words
 * Abstract
 * Atmospheric
 * Structural
* (Personal Names)

It is always possible to tell which class a word belongs to by looking at it.
For this they differ in a small number of features.
First by their sound length measured in mora.
The romanization is chosen so this can also be expressed in numbers of letters.
It can therefore easily be analysed by machine.
Only proper verbs start with a glottal stop.
Except when a verb is in the process of being grammaticalized.
* Grammatical particles are only one or two mora long.
  2 to 4 letters.
  They start with a consonant other than the glottal stop.
  Example: bu, buko
* Verbs begin with a glottal stop and end in a vowel. They are at least two mora long.
  Minimum 3 letters of which the first is '.
  Example: 'ai, 'usbane
* Content words are at least three mora long.
  Minimum 5 letters.
  They start with a consonant other than the glottal stop.
  Example: cykte, tatakena

### Grammatical particles

### Verbs

Verbs only describe actions that result in one state at a time changing into another state in a later time.
Therefor verbs like "move, say, play, think" are possible, but "be, have, sit, own, relate, mean, display" are not. The later examples are expressed using other word classes.
Verbs are satellite framed in the way that manner is expressed with **vii** + adjective. Direction is expressed using **cor kol guj**, "away towards around" and the prefixes **vo**- and **ni**-.
**malan vo'ele cor nia vii huahua**
malan (vo('ele) cor (nia) vii (huahua))
Q.listener.is.topic towards.speaker-move to east like wind
"Will you go east to me, fast like the wind?"
(Sidenote: There are no real pronouns in this sentence.)

Verbs can be derived from nouns by omitting all initial and final consonants and adding a glottal stop in front.
Because of the limitations of meaning, the derived meaning of the verb always is the action that is neccessary to create or become the noun.
As an example the word **mama** "woman, mother" turns into **'ama** "to become a woman, to be pregnant". While the english phrase indicates a state, to be pregnant is in fact an action following the above definition.

### Adjectives-Nouns

Content words serve both the role of adjectives and nouns.
There is no distinction between the two. Therefor they are called "adjectives" in this grammar.
Adjectives can be abstract, atmospheric or structural. The distinction often is blurred.
* Abstract adjectives are concepts that can be defined or understood. e.g. nibana, gorok
* Atmospheric ones can link to a memory, a feeling, an image. e.g. hukbar
* Structural describe a pattern, or fractal properties. They are between abstract and atmospheric adjectives.

### Personal names

Personal names can form nicknames by reduplicating the last syllable. ('amabery > ryry)
The distinction between full names and nicknames is the same as je-ge and bu.
Usually speakers describe persons just like they describe objects in the world.
The personal name is something mostly used between people that know each other closer.
It is about as common to know someones name as it is in English to know someones nickname.


Grammar
-------


### Aux verb

|          |     | past (d) | past2   | nonpast  | gnomic |
| -------- | --- | -------- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
|          |     | -ii/ee   | -ia     | -aa/uu   | -yy    |
| hearsay  | h-  | lii      | -       | laa      | lyy    |
| infered  | r-  | ree      | ria     | ruu      | ryy    |
| exp. (d) | c-  | cii      | cia     | ciu      | cyy    |
| que.     | m-  | mee      | mia     | maa      | myy    |
| neg.     | v-n | vin      | -       | van      | vyn    |

"Negation" v-n is used to express the lack of knowledge.
Because it also lacks inferred knowledge, it can be translated as "I don't think so".
past: an event in the past
past2: "continuous past" an event in the past with a continuous story to the present.
non-past: including present, future, conditional.
gnomic: general relations that do not change over time.


### Allocutive agreement

The aux. verb can change depending on the situation the listener is in.
This has the use that
* The speaker pays attention to the role of the listener.
* The listener knows that the speaker cares about them and their discussion.
* As some sort of vocative and topic marker.

This system is based on an idea Kirble developed for the conlang "Cavelan" and the way Basque does something similar.

The gnomic topic is omitted because the topic of a gnomic statement can not be a living being.

|          |         |  Ø  | introduce  | topic  | listen |
| -------- | ------- | --- | ---------- | ------ | ------ |
|          |         |     | -VtVk      | -VprV  | -VsV   |

|          | gnomic  | ryy | ry 'yk     | ry lyn | -      |
| exp.     | past    | cii | ci 'ik     | ci lin | cisi   |
|          | past2   | cia | ci tak     | ci lia | cisa   |
|          | nonpast | ciu | ci tuk     | ci liu | cisu   |
|          | gnomic  | cyy | cy 'yk     | cy lyn | -      |

|          | past2   | mia | mi tak     | mi lia | misa   |
|          | nonpast | maa | ma 'ak     | ma lan | masa   |
|          | gnomic  | myy | my 'yk     | my lyn | -      |

**Introduce**
Listener is new to discussion or was not listening for a while. Maybe a vocative.
**matak tenpo**
Q.NONPAST.INTRODUCE time
"Excuse me, what time is it?" or "Hey, what time?"

**Listen**
Listener is part of the discussion but not it's topic.
**cipra tenpo ny cee**
EXPERIENCE.PAST2.LISTEN time fraction two
"Let me tell you, it seemed like midnight." (ny cee -> half a day)

**Topic**
Listener is topic of the discussion. Can be used to compensate the vagueness of "ge".
**mese 'enuma**
Q.PAST.TOPIC make.stuff.up
"Have you made this up?"


### Relationals

The idea for relationals is totally copied from [Kēlen](http://www.terjemar.net/kelen.php).
Go there to read more about the concept, idea and functions of relationals.
Relations can form arbitrary large chains. They can span across multiple sentences.
Each element is prefixed with the relational particle.
jyn lyy - jyn ryy - jyn cyy "knowledge leads to intellectual understanding leads to personal understanding"

|                    |     | example |
| ------------------ | --- | ------- |
| existence          | la  | la moon la stars
| change/states      | ti  | ti child ti teen ti adult
| association        | no  | no house no tree no street
| direct causation   | kia | kia falling kia breaking
| systemic causation | jyn | jyn smoking jyn cancer


### Pronouns

|                 | default | indivisible | divisible
| --------------- | ------- | ----------- | ---------
| **1p.exc**      | je      | jeky        | jeto
| **1p.incl (d)** | bu      | buku        | buta
| **self-exc**    | ge      | geky        | geto

In speech you change between using both je and ge or only bu depending on the situation.


### na-va-pe vo-ni

na- va- and pe- are prefixes that can be added to adjectives, verbs and pronouns.
They show the speakers personal judgement of the object. Only in quotes it is used for other persons.
* na - attraction
* va - neutral
* pe - aversion

Example:
'ai - [verb] to act emotional, to experience emotions
na'ai - to like, to act nice
pe'ai - to dislike, to be mean

vo- and ni- can in a similar way be used to show the direction of a verb.
* vo - towards the speaker
* ni - away from the speaker, towards someone/something else

Example:
**nani'ai ne?**
"Do you know I like you?"


### Reduplication

Two types of redupliction are used to narrow or widen the meaning of a word.

**Partial**

First syllable gets reduplicated an reduced to an open syllable.
Used to express totality, precision, certainty.
Used to form proper nouns out of short roots. Which is considered to be the same as above.
CV > CVCV
CVR > CVCVR
CV¹V² > CV¹CV¹CV²
CNV > CVCNV

**Full**

To widen the meaning, blurring it, or adding uncertainty.

In numbers, using the bases:
sye 12
syesye 6 to 12
gej 60
gejgej 12 to 60

Full reduplication of a word that contains partial reduplication leads to it's loss.
tatakena > takenatakena


### "Singular" (outdated)

Content words have no number, in best case they can be viewed as plural by default.
(For a singular or indefinite noun, prefix the phrase with "ny".
In the context of mathematical numbers "ny" expresses fractions.)


### Lists

Words and lists can both be elements in a list.
Within a list all elements are interchangeable while the meaning remains the same.
**sivat selet kilin** = **sivat kilin selet** = **kilin selet sivat** = "fresh fractal leaflike"
An exception to this are verbs which apply to all preceding elements in a list.
In this abstract example the addition sign is a verb.
(1 2 3 +) = 6
(3 1 2 +) = 6
(3 1 + 2) = (4 2)


### Filters

Every word can serve as a filter for a list.
Structure is f(l) where f() is the filter and l the list.
A filter reduces the broad/atmospheric meaning of a word to a more specific one.
No list as input is the same as every possible input.
**bal'ukbar**
bal(hukbar)
Every language aspect (=bal) of hukbar.


### Sentence structure

**Asking for particular information**
jen = insito question word
**la jen 'akte**
"What/Who acted?"

**la 'akte vii jen**
"Something/someone acted in which way?"


**Yes/No question**
**ge maa 'ai**
DEM Q-NONPAST experience.emotions
"Are you (acting) emotional?"
Possible answers:
* Confirm information: "ciu" - EXP-NONPAST
* Correct information: "ge ciu leilei" 1 EXP-NONPAST calm
* Lack of information: "maa (pye)" Q-NONPAST (previous statement)
* Negation: "van 'ai"


### Abbreviation/Contraction

Common phrases gaining a different meaning then their individual parts get contracted.
Each morpheme gets reduce on it's own. Two only merge when both are reduced to one open syllable.
For each iteration the reduction happens first per syllable and then merging those.

**Per syllable**
(C)Vː	> CV
(C)V¹V²	> CV¹
CVR	> CV
CNV	> CV	inside words
CNV	> CN	word final

**Merging**
(C)V¹.V²	> CV¹V²	if proper diphthong
(C)V¹.V²	> CV¹	if no proper diphthong
(C)V.C²V	> CVR	according to the manner of articulation of C² except for p and k
C¹V.C¹V		> C¹VV	if propper dipthong otherwise CVR
