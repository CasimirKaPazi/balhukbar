Writing is lowercase only.  
< h > is silent word initial. Vowel preceding h are lengthened. < VhV > /VːV/.  
Geminated consonants (e.g. pakku) are either lengthened or separated by copying the next vowel (e.g. pakuku).  
All vowels can be long. Written by doubling e.g. "cii"  
Vowel length is only distinctive in monosyllabic words.  
p-b k-g '-h are allophones in most cases. '-h are only distinctive word initial.  


<div id='Syllable-Shape'/>

### Syllable shape

(C)V(R)  
(C)VV  
CN(V)  

syllable | example
-------- | -------
1 mora:  |
V	     | ho
CV	     | ka
CN	     | mn
2 mora:  |
Vː	     | hyy
VV	     | hai
CVː	     | gaa
CVV	     | pye
CVR	     | sen
CNV	     | bra

Syllables with one mora are written with two letters.  
Those with two mora are written with three letters.  
h is used to fill the gaps.  
CN syllables only appear as monosyllabic words (mostly interrogations) or word final.

R = n t j r l k  
N = n v s r l (act syllabic)  
V = a u i o y e  
Vː = aa uu ii oo yy ee  
VV = ye yo ia ai au ua (ey eo oe oy iu ui)


<div id='Vowel-Groups'/>

### Vowel groups/Vowel harmony

        y
    i--/-\--u
     \/   \/
     e\---/o
       \ /
        a

Vowels come in two groups differing by advanced and retracted tongue root.

* [+ATR] a u i
* [-ATR] o y e

They can be seen as the remains of a former vowel harmony which is no longer productive. Still most morphemes come with either one of those groups.  
Only vowels within a group can form diphthongs.  
High to low and front to back combinations are more common.  


<div id='Word-Classes'/>

Word classes
------------

Word are mostly grouped within three bigger word classes:
* Grammatical particles
  * Interrogations
  * Pronouns
  * Relationals
  * Grammatical markers
  * Auxiliary "verb"
  * Numbers
  * Filters
  * Directions
  * Time markers
  * ...
* Verbs
* Adjectives-Nouns/Content-words
  * Abstract
  * Atmospheric
  * Structural
* (Personal Names)

It is often possible to tell which class a word belongs to by looking at it.  
For this they differ in a small number of features.  
Length is currently expressed in mora.  
Only proper verbs start with a glottal stop.  
Except when a verb is in the process of being grammaticalized.  
* Grammatical particles are only one or two mora long.  
  2 to 4 letters.  
  They start with a consonant other than the glottal stop.  
  Example: bu, buko
* Verbs begin with a glottal stop and end in a vowel. They are at least two mora long.  
  Minimum 3 letters of which the first is '.  
  Example: 'ai, 'usbane
* Content words are at least three mora long.  
  Minimum 5 letters (some exceptions).  
  They start with a consonant other than the glottal stop.  
  Example: cykte, tatakena

### Grammatical particles


<div id='Verbs'/>

### Verbs

Verbs only describe actions that result in one state at a time changing into another state in a later time.
Therefor verbs like "move, say, play, think" are possible, but "be, have, sit, own, relate, mean, display" are not. The later examples are expressed using other word classes.
Verbs are satellite framed in the way that manner is expressed with **vii** + adjective. Direction is expressed using **cor kol guj**, "away towards around" and the prefixes **vo**- and **ni**-.

**malan vo'ele cor nia vii huahua**  
malan (vo('ele) cor (nia) vii (huahua))  
Q.listener.is.topic towards.speaker-move to east like wind  
"Will you go east to me, fast like the wind?"  
(Sidenote: There are no real pronouns in this sentence.)

Verbs can be derived from nouns by omitting all initial and final consonants and adding a glottal stop in front.  
Because of the limitations of meaning, the derived meaning of the verb always is the action that is neccessary to create or become the noun.
As an example the word **mama** "woman, mother" turns into **'ama** "to become a woman, to be pregnant". While the english phrase indicates a state, to be pregnant is in fact an action following the above definition.


<div id='Nouns'/>

### Adjectives-Nouns

Content words serve both the role of adjectives and nouns.  
There is no distinction between the two. Therefor they are called "adjectives" in this grammar.  
Adjectives can be abstract, atmospheric or structural. The distinction often is blurred.  
* Abstract adjectives are concepts that can be defined or understood. e.g. nibana, gorok
* Atmospheric ones can link to a memory, a feeling, an image. e.g. hukbar
* Structural describe a pattern, or fractal properties. They are between abstract and atmospheric adjectives.


<div id='Names'/>

### Personal names

Personal names can form nicknames by reduplicating the last syllable. ('amabery > ryry)  
The distinction between full names and nicknames is the same as je-ge and bu.  
Usually speakers describe persons just like they describe objects in the world.  
The personal name is something mostly used between people that know each other closer.  
It is about as common to know someones name as it is in English to know someones nickname.


<div id='Morphology'/>
Morphology
----------


<div id='AUX-Verb'/>

### AUX-Verb/Tense, Place and Evidence

Tense and Evidence are intervened, giving rise to a, on the large scale, tree way distinction: *presence*, *absence*, *continuous*.  
* Presence: Everything in the direct experience in the present moment. It therefor is both present tense and direct evidence. The music I hear right now falls into this tense-evidence.
* Absence: The counterpart to presence in the way that it includes everything what is in the past or outside of the perception. It might be the contents of a story you heard as a child (hearsay) or hearing the story as a child (past). Absence can further be marked for the concrete evidence: Own past experience, hearsay and inference.
* Continuous: Because the presence is so brief and limited a lot of the things you would talk about that happened "just now" would fall into the absence. For this the Connected experience is used whenever you could tell a continuous story from that past experience to the present. As abbreviation "CONT" is used in this document.

| Perception | evidence-tense | aux |
| ---------- | -------------- | --- |
| Presence   | exp present    | ciu |
| Negation   | neg present    | van |
| Continuous | exp near-past  | cia |
| Absence    | exp past       | cii |
|            | inf            | ruu |
|            | hrs            | laa |
|            | neg            | vir |
| Question   | Q              | maa |

"Negation" v-n is used to express the lack of knowledge.  
Because it also lacks inferred knowledge, it can be translated as "I don't think so".  


<div id='Conversation'/>

### Conversation

The conversation markers show the relation listener and speaker are in. They can either precede the sentence as a whole or the aux. verb.
Intended effects are:  
* The speaker pays attention to the role of the listener.
* The listener knows that the speaker cares about them and their discussion.
* As some sort of vocative and topic marker. To manage dicourse.

This system is inspired by an idea Kirble developed for the conlang "Cavelan" and the way Basque does something vaguely similar.

* Vocative:  Listener is new to conversation or was not listening for a while.  
  **halo**
* Listen: Listener is part of the conversation but not it's topic.  
  **ha**
* Topic: Listener is topic of the discussion. Can be used to compensate the vagueness of "ge".  
  **tu**
* Monologue: Holding a monologue, talking to one self, thinking out loud.  
  **mn**

Introduce  
**halo maa tenpo**  
VOC Q.NONPAST time  
"Excuse me, what time is it?" or "Hey, what time?"

Listen  
**ha cia tenpo ny cee**  
LISTEN EXP.CONT.LISTEN time fraction two  
"Let me tell you, it seemed like midnight." (ny cee -> half a day)

Topic  
**tu maa 'enuma**  
TOP.2 Q.PAST make.stuff.up  
"Have you made this up?"


### Relationals (outdated, will be merged into the auxiliary verb)

The idea for relationals is totally copied from [Kēlen](http://www.terjemar.net/kelen.php).  
Go there to read more about the concept, idea and functions of relationals.  
Relations can form arbitrary large chains. They can span across multiple sentences.  
Each element is prefixed with the relational particle.  

|                    |     | example |
| ------------------ | --- | ------- | ---
| existence          | la  | la moon la stars | 
| change/states      | ti  | ti child ti teen ti adult | 
| association        | no  | no house no tree no street | -> See genitive
| direct causation   | kia | kia falling kia breaking | 
| systemic causation | jyn | jyn smoking jyn cancer | 


<div id='Pronouns'/>

### Pronouns

Persons are specified by clusivity.

|              | default | quotative |
| ------------ | ------- | --------- |
| listener-exc | ja/jaky | jama      |
| other-exc    | bu/buku | bumu      |
| speaker-exc  | ge/geky | geme      |
| any/everyone | kyne    | -         |

They don't distinguish by number. So je can be either "I" or "we.exclusive", ge is "you, he, she, it, they, this, that..." So anything but excluding one self. Talking to each other the speaker would either use those two pronouns, or only bu, depending on context. bu is in the middle of the two, it can mean any of "we.incl, I, you" and is used when the speakers are in the same position.

As an example; If I want to sit down in the bus but someone has their bag on the seat I would ask "Can I (=je) sit there (=ge)? Can you (=ge) take the bag away?" Because the person is sitting and I don't have a seat we are not in the same position and therefor use je-ge. When I then sit down we will continue talking using bu. bu also serves the function the English "one" has. Because this is very vague the language has some further tools to indicate who is meant. For one you can add adjectives to pronouns e.g. ge-sitting, and ge-baglike. It is also possible to mark the auxiliary verb to whether the listener is the topic of the sentence or not. See: Conversation.

Quotative pronouns are used in direct quotes "They said 'We.QUOT will help you.QUOT.'" as opposed to reported speech "They said that they will help us."


<div id='Affixes'/>

### Affixes

-na -va and -pe are suffixes that can be added to adjectives, verbs and pronouns.  
They show the speakers personal judgement of the object. Only in quotes it is used for other persons perception.

* na - attraction
* va - neutral
* pe - aversion

Example:
'ai - [verb] to act emotional, to experience emotions  
na'ai - to like, to act nice  
pe'ai - to dislike, to be mean  

vo- and ni- can in a similar way be used to show the direction of a verb.  
* vo - towards the speaker
* ni - away from the speaker, towards someone/something else

Example:
**ni'aina ne?**  
"Do you know I like you?"  


<div id='Reduplication'/>

### Reduplication

Two types of reduplication are used to narrow or widen the meaning of a word.

**Partial**

First syllable gets reduplicated an reduced to an open syllable.  
Used to express totality, precision, certainty.  
Used to form proper nouns out of short roots. Which is considered to be the same as above.  
CV > CVCV  
CVR > CVCVR  
CV¹V² > CV¹CV¹CV²  
CNV > CVCNV  

**Full**

To widen the meaning, blurring it, or adding uncertainty.

In numbers, using the bases:  
sye 12  
syesye 6 to 12  
gej 60  
gejgej 12 to 60  

Full reduplication of a word that contains partial reduplication leads to it's loss.  
tatakena > takenatakena


<div id='Singular'/>

### "Singular"

Nouns have no number, in best case they can be viewed as plural by default.  
It is possible to indicate that only one object is revered using a demonstrative and the number one.
However, it is rarely used. It is better to thread nouns as numberless adjectives.
**maa ge bat jen**
Q DEM one what
"What is this one thing?" 


<div id='Abbreviation'/>

### Abbreviation/Contraction

Common phrases gaining a different meaning then their individual parts get contracted.  
Each morpheme gets reduce on it's own. Two only merge when both are reduced to one open syllable.  
For each iteration the reduction happens first per syllable and then merging those.  

**Per syllable**  
(C)Vː	> CV  
(C)V¹V²	> CV¹  
CVR	> CV  
CNV	> CV	inside words  
CNV	> CN	word final  

**Merging**  
(C)V¹.V²	> CV¹V²	if proper diphthong  
(C)V¹.V²	> CV¹	if no proper diphthong  
(C)V.C²V	> CVR	according to the manner of articulation of C² except for p and k  
C¹V.C¹V		> C¹VV	if propper dipthong otherwise CVR  


<div id='Syntax'/>

Syntax
------


<div id='Lists'/>

### Lists

Words and lists can both be elements in a list.  
Within a list all elements are interchangeable while the meaning remains the same.  
**sivat selet kilin** = **sivat kilin selet** = **kilin selet sivat** = "fresh fractal leaflike"  
An exception to this are verbs which apply to all preceding elements in a list.  
In this abstract example the addition sign is a verb.  
(1 2 3 +) = 6  
(3 1 2 +) = 6  
(3 1 + 2) = (4 2)  


<div id='Filters'/>

### Filters

Every word can serve as a filter for a list.  
Structure is f(l) where f() is the filter and l the list.  
A filter reduces the broad/atmospheric meaning of a word to a more specific one.  
No list as input is the same as every possible input.  
**bal'ukbar**  
bal(hukbar)  
Every language aspect (=bal) of hukbar.  


<div id='Questions'/>

### Questions

**Asking for particular information**  
jen = insito question word  
**la jen 'akte**  
"What/Who acted?"  

**la 'akte vii jen**  
"Something/someone acted in which way?"

**Yes/No question**  
**ge maa 'ai**  
DEM Q-NONPAST experience.emotions  
"Are you (acting) emotional?"  
Possible answers:  
* Confirm information: "ciu" - EXP.NONPAST  
* Correct information: "ge ciu leilei" 1 EXP.NONPAST calm  
* Lack of information: "maa (pye)" Q.NONPAST (previous statement)  
* Negation: "van 'ai"  


<div id='Genitive'/>

### Genitive

Possession has three different forms analogue to the tenses (presence, absence, contineous). However the term "Genitive" is used just for the lack of a better one. In fact the meaning is more one of a symmetrical relationship of A associated with B, where both elements are interchangeable.

* In the presence the possessor and the possessed are threaten as one entity. Therefor the genitive is unmarked and resembles a normal noun phrase.
* In the absence of one element the particle **no** is used to connect the two.
* The contineous absence uses **nyo** just like the absence.

Inalienable possession is always in the presence (almost only body parts).


<div id='Numeral-System'/>

Numeral system
--------------

The "least common multiple numeral system" is used. Be warned that this is very unwieldy to use.
The original inspiration draws from the Sumerian and Akkadian bases 60 and 12. While they are quite unusual they have the useful property to have several denominators. 12 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, while 60 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. We can search for other such numbers, e.g. 6 which is the smallest number divisible by 2 and 3, 420 the smallest divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.  
Picking up that pattern we create a list of the smallest numbers that are divisible by all integers from 1 to n. That is:

    1, 2, 6, 12, 60, 420, 820, 2520, 27720, 360360, 720720, . . .

The series can be found on the online encyclopedia of integer series as [A051451](https://oeis.org/A051451).  

If there are so many useful bases, which one should we choose for our numeral system? The answer is not in using a fixed radix system (like base 10 is) but a mixed radix. That means that every place has a different value, in this case the series above. It turns out that someone already thought about such a thing and gave it the name [LCM-numeral-system](https://oeis.org/wiki/LCM_numeral_system). The article on the OEIS wiki gives a comprehensive explanation which I spare to double here. In the following I assume you read it. The probably most important conclusion to draw is that;

> This may be the "smallest" product-based numbering system that has a unique finite representation for every rational number.

Russell Easterly, Oct 03 2001 As comment to the before mentioned series.

This statement includes fractions. This means a fraction like 1/3 which in base ten is 0.333333... can be expressed as 0.02, which reads `0*1/2 + 2*1/6`. While the number 3 is represented as 11 which reads 1 * 2 + 1 * 1. In the effect expressing fractions is much easier and useful then in any fixed radix system, while expressing integers is quite harder.

Now this is where it comes back to the language and it's culture. Where cultures with a standard base system (just about all cultures we know about) use mostly integers to talk about the world and the objects they find in it, the speakers of bal'ukbar use both, integers and fractions. This gives rise to the divisible-indivisible distinction. For every thing that is divisible in the way that smaller parts have the same quality - e.g. water, sand, stone, wood, time, place - fractions are used. Things that change it's properties by dividing - e.g. living things, a boule, body parts, most things crafted - are revered by integers.

Therefor to talk about the time of day for example, instead of inventing smaller units called "hours" they talk about half a day, two sixth a day, one half and one twelvth a day etc.

A number like 7829 (base 10) would be written as 30042021 (base LCM).

    3*2520 + 0*840 + 0*420 + 4*60 + 2*12 + 0*6 + 2*2 + 1*1

For big number it can happen however that the place value is bigger than 9. This would lead to confusion since it would not be apparent where a place starts and where it ends. In this case they are separated by ":". Using 360000 (base 10) as an example, it renders as `12:10:2:1:1:0:0:0:0;` We can shorten the zeros down to a representation of `12:10:2:1:1::::;` As you might have noticed it uses base ten numbers in this representation. This of course is just a convention of the romanization. In the culture going with the language there would be one symbol each for every possible step. We could also use the letters A, B, C, D... starting from 10, 11, 12, 13...  
The ";" marks the switch from integers to fractions. The circle constant Tau 6.2831... (base 10) therefore is written as `100;01116126...` or `1::;:1:1:1:6:1:2:6:...`
